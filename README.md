# Energy Consumption Forecasting with Transformers

This repository provides a workflow for forecasting household energy consumption using a Transformer-based model. The process includes data acquisition, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Structure

- `src/` – Python package with core functions for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
- `notebooks/` – Presentation notebooks
- `data/` – Raw and intermediate data
- `README.md` – Project description

## Setup

1. Create a Python environment (e.g., with venv or conda)
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook `energy_forecast_transformer.ipynb` to reproduce the workflow and results.

## Usage

- Use the modules in `src/` for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- The notebook demonstrates the full pipeline from raw data to evaluation and visualization.
